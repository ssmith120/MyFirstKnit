Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can
get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas. For each question,
insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a
complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation.
Half the points in this assignment depend on your picture and name being
correct!! Be sure to put your photo in the AAA\_Owner\_Info folder and
call it My\_photo.jpg after first renaming the current one to Koala.jpg
.

\#\#Where are you now?\\

similiar row in other classes? What is the computer number where you are
sitting? How on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=low, 10=high) How you feel about
periodic seat re-assignment, say how and why. Teams, have you ever
worked on one in a class setting?

\#\#\#my answer

I am sitting in row four on the far left. I usually tend to sit in the
back. I don't like being told where to sit. We are all adults so chosing
our seats seems like something we should be able to do without issue.
I've worked on multiple group projects in a class setting.

\#\#Others and You?\\
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor,

I like to be called Symon (Simon).

\#\#Aspirations?\\
What do you want to achieve in life? What college subject do you think
would be of the greatest interest to you? What degree or certificate are
you trying to achieve?

\#\#\#my answer

I'm hoping to get my MBA so that I can advance further in the work place
and move into a management roll eventually.

\#\#Past adventures?\\
Have you ever gone to foreign countries, if so which ones, if not Where
might you go in the future? Have you ever been in the military, if so
which branch, if not which branch would you choose if you got drafted,
and why?

\#\#\#my answer

I've been to the UK specifically to Wales. I plan on traveling to Italy
and Japan. I have never been in the military if I got drafted I would
prefer the Airforce or the Navy. I would choose either brach because
I've had family in both braches.

\#\#Why are you taking Math 115?\\
What grade do you need to attain in stats to not upset your future
plans, What is your plan?

\#\#\#my answer

I need to obtain a B or higher to stay on track with graduating Spring
2020.

\#\#Homework Help and Getting around?\\
On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse
from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and
out) How do you rate yourself? Do you have a computer you can use at
home? If so, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)? Do you have
internet access at home?\\
How do you get to class? Are there issues that limit when you can be at
the college?Where and when did you attend high school? Do you currently
have a job?

\#\#\#my answer

I would rate myself as around a 6 or 7 when it comes to being computer
literate. Yes, I have a windows computer and yes I also have internet
access at home. I drive myself to class, and no I don't have any issues
that will limit my being in class. I attended graduated High School in
2011. I currently have 3 jobs.
